HiðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Tiisetso Tebele.

Iâ€™m into software development, started programming in 2018 (my first year at university) and from then since, I've been passionate about this and building software to solve real world problems.

Currently learning JavaScript and a whole lot other technologies like that will likely help in reaching my objectives in terms of developing best softwares.
I'm definitely up for collaborating with any individual or group with whom our goals are aligned.

To get in touch with me, here's my Twitter handle: @TiisetsoTivoli3.

Thanks.
